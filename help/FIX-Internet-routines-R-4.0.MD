# :wrench: Fix the "internet routines" error for R-4.0

> Pssst... This is frustrating but it really isn't R's fault. So please don't blame R. It's trying its hardest to help you, but our Org's permissions are blocking it. :cry:  

## 1. Go to your R-4.0.2 folder

It should be here: 

> `C:\Program Files\R\`

## 2. **COPY** it

## 3. Go to your `Documents` folder

It should be here *(replace your username ex.HSolo)*:

> `C:\Users\**yourusername**\Documents\`

## 4. Paste the `R-4.0.2` folder

Click a file in that directory and then **`CTRL+V`** to paste the folder.

## 5. Open RStudio 

- Go to `Tools` -> `Global options...` 
- Select the `[Change]` button at the top-right, next to the R-version box
- Select "Choose a specific version..."
- Choose the 64 bit option located in your Documents folder
- Click `OK`
- Select `OK` at the bottom of the menu
