# AT-AT Radio Frequencies

This file contains the recorded radio frequencies used by the Empire's AT walkers on the planet Hoth. R2D2 bartered with another droid for the data and promised some unknown compensation in return. From first glance, the data looks like a bunch of random noise to me. Hopefully we don't regret this.
