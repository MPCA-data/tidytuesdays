### :book: Reading aloud

They say reading makes great writing.  

Let's practice reading R scripts aloud and have our parnter interpret what we say back into code. It's kind of like the game telephone, but for R.

#### Steps

_First find a partner and decide who gets to be **Bert** and who's **Ernie**._

1. Bert looks at the first code block and reads it to Ernie.
1. Ernie then writes a code snippet that follows what Bert said.
1. Bert can offer more clues to help
    - But try **NOT** say the names of functions explicitly, like "`filter`" or "use `select`"

### Bert reads: block 1
