FYI! 

Our cat shelter **The Meow House** is overflowing with found cats and we're recruiting expert detectives to help these cats find their home.

### Instructions

1. Get to know your cat's personality traits and determine its age as best you can. 
    - Useful packages: `library(tidyverse)`, `library(lubridate)`
    - Useful functions: `read_csv()`, `today()`, `ymd()`, `duration(10, "years")
2. Find the earliest possible birthday 🍰 for your cat. Then find the latest possible birthday for your cat. 
4. Consult the BIG missing cat list to help find the cat's worried owner.
*(They will be oh so forever grateful)*
    - Useful functions: `mutate()`, one of the date functions `mdy()` or `dmy()` or `ymd()`, `filter()`
