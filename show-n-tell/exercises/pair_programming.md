# Pair programming

> "Two pears are better than one."  

Let's practice writing R scripts as a team. One partner will convey what you want to accomplish, while the other is in charge of writing the R script. There's no pressure at all, but there might be sugaR :candy: points on the line - just saying.

#### Steps

_Use Teams to "call" your partner. The person who can open R the quickest should share their screen. They will be the first script doctor. The other person gets to be the coach / fan / moral support for the first go.

1. The script writer will start reading in the data using the given code.
1. The coach will look at the desired end goal and think about some possible first steps.
1. Then the coach will do their best to convey the goal and steps to their partner as they start building their script.
